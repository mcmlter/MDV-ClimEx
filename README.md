# MDV ClimEx
McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER Climate Explorer (MDV ClimEx) is an interactive, open-source web application designed to (1) visualize long-term meteorological records from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica and (2) apply a standardized, univariate approach to identifying climate anomalies within this region. MDV ClimEx quantifies anomaly magnitude as the number of standard deviations (Ïƒ) by which common meteorological variables, such as air temperature, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation, deviate from historical averages within sites and across timescales (i.e., daily, monthly, or seasonal). 

This repository accompanies a manuscript that is currently under review for publication in a scientific journal. Upon publication, this README file will be updated with detailed methodology and a link to the published manuscript.
